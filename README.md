# Iterated guessing experiment

This is an iterative (dynamic) experiment, implemented with [magpie](https://magpie-manual.netlify.app/).

Participants guess mundane quantities (e.g., average calorie intake per day of an adult UK citizen). 
They also receive the guess of the previous participant (possibly creating a king of iterative anchoring effect). 

Online version: https://magpie-ea.github.io/magpie3-iterated-guessing/
